# Gamma_Ray
## Project Description
This was a personal project to recreate a white paper from Analog Devices on using a PIN photodode as a Gamma Ray detector.

The original insparation was from a Hack-A-Day article [USE A CHEAP PIN DIODE AS A GEIGER COUNTER](https://hackaday.com/blog/?s=cheap+pin+diode)

## Results

The project was successful and when the comparator setpoint was set correctly it will chatter when placed near gamma ray emitting sources or strong background radiation.
